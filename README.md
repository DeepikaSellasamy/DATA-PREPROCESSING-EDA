# DATA-PREPROCESSING-EDA

Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering:

        * We spend a lot of time refining our raw data. Data pre-processing and Feature Engineering plays a key role in any data process.
         
        * Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and preparing the raw data to enable feature engineering

        * Feature Engineering covers various data engineering techniques such as adding/removing relevant features, handling missing data, encoding the data, handling               categorical variables, etc

        * Feature Engineering is one of the most crucial tasks and plays a major role in determining the outcome of a model

        * Feature engineering involves the creation of features, whereas preprocessing involves cleaning the data. 

        * The Data pre-processing, Feature Engineering, and EDA steps will be carried out in this project using Python.
        
 #### Objective:
 
The goal of this project was to perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of used cars. The dataset consisted of 10,000 rows and 9 columns, containing information about the make, model, year, selling price, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and number of owners of the cars.

#### Data Preprocessing:

The first step in the project was to clean and preprocess the data. This involved handling missing data, identifying and handling outliers, and transforming the data into a usable format.

#### EDA:

Once the data was cleaned, the next step was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data. The EDA involved visualizing the data using various plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

#### Python Libraries Used:

The project was implemented using Python, and various Python libraries were used, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy.

#### Data Preprocessing Techniques Used:

Handling Missing Data: The missing values in the dataset were identified and replaced with appropriate values.
Outlier Detection and Handling: Outliers were detected and handled using box plots.
Data Transformation: The data was transformed to make it more usable, including converting categorical data to numerical data and normalizing the data.
EDA Techniques Used:

#### Data Visualization: 

Various plots were created, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to visualize the data and identify patterns and relationships.
Correlation Analysis: Correlation analysis was performed to identify the correlation between the different variables in the dataset.
