# DATA-PREPROCESSING-EDA

Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering:

         We spend a lot of time refining our raw data. Data pre-processing and Feature Engineering plays a key role in any data process.
         
         Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and preparing the raw data to enable feature engineering

         Feature Engineering covers various data engineering techniques such as adding/removing relevant features, handling missing data, encoding the data, handling               categorical variables, etc

         Feature Engineering is one of the most crucial tasks and plays a major role in determining the outcome of a model

         Feature engineering involves the creation of features, whereas preprocessing involves cleaning the data. 

         The Data pre-processing, Feature Engineering, and EDA steps will be carried out in this project using Python.
